# MeshCraft-RNA
## A Specialized Pipeline for RNA-Amino Acid Binding Meshes
Meshcraft RNA is a cutting-edge computational pipeline designed to generate meshes of amino acid residues that are capable of binding to RNA. This pipeline is an integral component of our methodology, serving as the bridge between computational modeling and practical application in RNA-aptamer interactions.
